📖 About The Project

OrangeChat is designed to solve the complexity of modern chat applications. It focuses on a "Lean Governance" model where room management is strict but simple, ensuring secure communication without administrative bloat.

Unlike basic chat tutorials, OrangeChat implements Row Level Security (RLS) at the database layer, meaning user data is cryptographically isolated even if the frontend is compromised.

🚀 Key Features

🔒 Fortified Security

Strict Access: Unverified email addresses cannot sign in.

Middleware Protection: Next.js Middleware guards all dashboard routes.

Data Isolation: Users can never fetch messages from rooms they haven't joined.

⚡ Real-Time Performance

Sub-millisecond Latency: Powered by Supabase Realtime (Phoenix Channels).

Live Presence: Instant updates for message delivery and deletions.

👑 Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

🎨 Modern UI/UX

Dark/Light Mode: System-aware theme toggling.

Responsive Design: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.

💻 Tech Stack

Framework: Next.js 14 (App Router, Server Actions)

Language: TypeScript

Styling: Tailwind CSS & Lucide Icons

Backend-as-a-Service: Supabase

Database: PostgreSQL

Authentication: Supabase Auth (JWT)

🏗 Architecture & Security

This project does not rely on fragile API endpoints for security. Instead, it uses PostgreSQL Policies.

The Golden Rule: "Security lives in the Database, not the Frontend."

The Data Model

Profiles: Publicly readable profiles, strictly editable by the owner.

Rooms: Visible only to members of that room.

Messages: Insertable by members; Deletable only by Admins via RLS policy.

⚡ Getting Started

Prerequisites

Node.js 18+

npm or yarn

A free Supabase account

Installation

Clone the repo

git clone [https://github.com/AtharvaShastrakar/orangeChat.git](https://github.com/AtharvaShastrakar/orangeChat.git)
cd orangeChat


Install packages

npm install


Set up Environment Variables
Create a .env.local file in the root:

NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_project_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here


Run the App

npm run dev


💾 Database Setup

Run this SQL in your Supabase SQL Editor to create the tables and security policies:

-- 1. Create Profiles Table
create table public.profiles (
  id uuid references auth.users on delete cascade not null primary key,
  email text,
  avatar_url text
);

-- 2. Create Rooms Table
create table public.rooms (
  id uuid default gen_random_uuid() primary key,
  name text not null,
  group_id text unique default substr(md5(random()::text), 0, 8),
  created_by uuid references public.profiles(id)
);

-- 3. Create Membership Junction
create table public.room_members (
  room_id uuid references public.rooms(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid references public.profiles(id) on delete cascade,
  role text check (role in ('admin', 'member')),
  primary key (room_id, user_id)
);

-- 4. Create Messages Table
create table public.messages (
  id bigint generated by default as identity primary key,
  room_id uuid references public.rooms(id) on delete cascade,
  user_id uuid references public.profiles(id),
  content text not null,
  created_at timestamp with time zone default timezone('utc'::text, now())
);

-- 5. Enable Row Level Security (RLS)
alter table profiles enable row level security;
alter table rooms enable row level security;
alter table room_members enable row level security;
alter table messages enable row level security;

-- 6. Create Policies (Simplified Example)
create policy "Public profiles" on profiles for select using (true);
create policy "User can update own profile" on profiles for update using (auth.uid() = id);
